Wherever '##' this symbol is present, consider it as an instruction and/or guidance that I'm providing you for executing the task.

## You are a common criteria document compliance evaluation expert. You are evaluating whether all the documentational requirements that are to be considered while preparing a document (TOE summary Specifications in this case) are being satisfied or not. A TOE means 'Target of evaluation' or the network device that is under evaluation. The TOE can be either of type DISTRIBUTED i.e. comprising of multiple devices or components (for example Managers and sensors/ Parent devices and child devices, etc) or STANDALONE i.e. a single component. 

## In this case the TOE is <STANDALONE/DISTRIBUTED>.

## I've provided you 4 things which are described as follows: 
I) SFR statement: SFR stands for ‘Security Functional requirement’ which are named in this way "FAU_GEN.1", "FAU_GEN.2", FAU_STG.1" and in similar fashion. These specifies the security functions a TOE must implement to meet its security objectives. They define what security capabilities (e.g., authentication, encryption, audit logging) the TOE should provide. 
II) TSS text for SFRs: This statement explains how the TOE satisfies each SFR mentioned. The TSS text's contents are influenced with the selections made in its corresponding SFR and the guidelines mentioned in its corresponding TSS-requirements.   
III) TSS-requirements: These are the set of guidelines/rules based on which you must evaluate whether the content mentioned in the TSS text is sufficient or not.  
IV) Ans statement: This is a fixed format in which you must present your response in. The placeholders present in this must be filled appropriately.

## THOROUGHLY analyze the TSS-requirement and understand each statement in the requirement. Validate this requirement by verifying whether the conditions/information is present in the TSS text provided for that particular SFR. Compare and validate these requirements for each statement present in the requirement text for that particular SFR and ONLY APPEND THE RELEVANT STATEMENT FOR THAT REQUIREMENT STATEMENT in the placeholders (< >) appropriately in the "Ans" statement and remove the "< >" sign. For example, suppose the TSS text for FAU_GEN.1 is - "The TOE generates a comprehensive set of audit logs that identify specific TOE operation whenever an auditable event occurs. Auditable events are specified in Table 12 – Security Functional Requirements and Auditable Events. Each of the events specified in the audit records is in enough detail to identify the user with which the event is associated, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the outcome of the event and the type of event that occurred. Administrative tasks of generating, importing and deleting cryptographic keys identify the keys unique name. SSH public keys are identified by the username in the logs on the TOE." and the TSS-requirement for FAU_GEN.1 is - "For the administrative task of generating/importing, changing, or deleting of cryptographic keys as defined in FAU_GEN.1.1c, the TSS should identify what information is logged to identify the relevant key." then, ONLY INCLUDE THE INFORMATION LOGGED TO IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT KEY AS PER THE TSS TEXT FOR FAU_GEN.1. REMOVE THE PLACEHOLDER SIGN (< >) ONCE THE ANS HAS BEEN FILLED. 

## Refer the contents mentioned in the "SFR statement" where the "TSS-requirement" points towards a particular selection and/or functionality that is selected by the TOE in its particular SFR. For example, if a TSS-requirement for FAU_STG_EXT.1 says ""The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it details the behaviour of the TOE when the storage space for audit data is full. When the option ‘overwrite previous audit record’ is selected this description should include an outline of the rule for overwriting audit data. If ‘other actions’ are chosen such as sending the new audit data to an external IT entity, then the related behaviour of the TOE shall also be detailed in the TSS."" then go to the corresponding "SFR statement for FAU_STG_EXT.1" and check the selection for the TOE when the storage space for audit data is full and then fill the placeholder in the "Ans statement" accordingly as per the selection in the SFR statement. 

## If the evaluation activity cited in the "TSS-requirement" is dependent upon a particular selection made in the corresponding SFR and that selection has not been mentioned in the "SFR statement", frame the "Ans statement" as "<selection> is not selected for <SFR name> in the ST; hence this assurance activity is not applicable." For example, if a TSS-requirement for the SFR FPT_TUD_EXT.1 states ""If the options ‘support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ are chosen from the selection in FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS explains what actions are involved in automatic checking or automatic updating by the TOE, respectively."" however, ‘support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ has not been selected as per the "SFR statement" of FPT_TUD_EXT.1, then the "Ans statement" would be framed as ""‘Support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ is not selected for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 in the ST; hence this assurance activity is not applicable.""

## While evaluating the TSS-text as per the TSS-requirement guidelines, only consider the TSS-text, TSS-requirement and SFR statement pertaining to that particular SFR. DO NOT CONSIDER STATEMENTS from TSS-text of different SFRs to satisfy the TSS-requirement of a different SFR. E.g.: If the TSS-requirement for 'FAU_STG_EXT.1' states that the information related to TOE's behaviour when audit log buffer reaches its maximum must be present and this information is present in the TSS-text for 'FAU_GEN.1' and not 'FAU_STG_EXT.1' then, this requirement for FAU_STG_EXT.1 is NOT satisfied as this information must also be present in the TSS text for 'FAU_STG_EXT.1'. If such situation occurs, where the information as per the TSS-requirement for a particular SFR is on present in the TSS text of that SFR, THEN THIS MISSING INFORMATION WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A GAP.   

## If the TOE is STANDALONE then, disregard the TSS-requirements where DISTRIBUTED TOE is mentioned in brackets (for DISTRIBURED TOE) and mention the following statement in the "Ans" statement: "The TOE is not a distributed TOE; hence this assurance activity is not applicable." Do not consider this statement to be a gap to be filled in the "Excel" key.
If the TOE is DISTRIBUTED, then consider all the TSS-requirements provided.

## Now, as per the validation results:
If the requirement for the information that is supposed to be present in the TSS is being satisfied do the following:  
1) Find the placeholder that states “<paste the exact information from the TSS text for <<SFR>> here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for <<SFR>> >".
2) Copy the “exact” information/text/statements from the TSS which ONLY SATISFIES THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT STATEMENT (not the entire TSS text) and paste that information in the section and place identified in point 1) above; example: "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that:<Appropriate answer in the placeholder of the Ans statement>" [Always start the Ans statement with "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that:"]
If the requirement for the information that is supposed to be present in the TSS is not being satisfied do the following:
3) Find the placeholder that states “<paste the exact information from the TSS text for <<SFR>> here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for <<SFR>> >".
4) Replace the placeholder identified in point 3) above with the information that is to be included in the TSS text as per the requirement statement. 
5) Mention the information that is to be included in the TSS as per the requirement of that particular SFR in the following format: <SFR name that the requirement is for>: <information that is to be included in the TSS as per the requirement of that particular SFR>. (new number for new SFR)

6) Give a JSON formatted output with 'Array of Objects' schema that would contain 2 arrays as following: 

i] Array-1 named "DOC" that would contain 2 key-value pairs, one for 'SFR name' and other for the 'Ans for that SFR'. Information logging in "DOC": 
a) If the TSS-requirement for the TSS text is being satisfied the information logged under "DOC" would be as follows, {"SFR": "<SFR name>", "Ans#<answer number>: "<Appropriate answer in the placeholder of the Ans statement>"}. Where the Key-value for the first object (SFR name) is same, place the "Ans#<answer number>: <actual answer>" key-value in the same object, example, if SFR name 'FAU_GEN.1' is same for all a few 'Ans#' then the output would be {"SFR": "FAU_GEN.1", "Ans#1: "<Appropriate answer in the placeholder of the Ans statement>", "Ans#2: "<Appropriate answer in the placeholder of the Ans statement>" ... and so on}.
b) If the TSS-requirement for the TSS text is NOT being satisfied then the information logged in "DOC" would have first key-value (SFR name) the same BUT 'value' for the key 'Ans#<answer number>:" would be replaced with: "This requirement is not being satisfied. <followed by information as per step 4) above."

ii] Only FOR THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOT BEING SATISFIED, maintain another ARRAY (array of objects) named "Excel" with schema having 3 key-values pairs that record: i) The SFR name ii) Corresponding TSS-requirement iii) Missing information in the TSS text as per the requirement statement in the fourth column [from step 5 and step 6- i]b)].

## Only provide the Ans statements in JSON formatting at the output, DO NOT PROVIDE ANY EXPLANATIONS FOR THE ANS STATEMENT OR ANYTHING ADDITIONAL IN PLAINTEXT AT THE OUTPUT.

## DO NOT REWORD OR REFRAME THE STATEMENTS/TEXT FOR THE TSS OR THE TEXT THAT IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANS STATEMENT.
## MENTION ONLY THE STATEMENT FROM THE TSS TEXT THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENT FOR THAT PARTICULAR SFR. (only include the entire TSS text where its absolutely needed to satisfy the requirement).
