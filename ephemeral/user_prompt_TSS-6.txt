--------------------

TSS text for FCS_TLSS_EXT.1:
The TSF supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 for HTTPS/TLS. If the TSF receives a ClientHello message that requests TLSv1.1 or earlier, the TSF sends a fatal handshake_failure message and terminates the connection.
The TSF supports and proposes the following cipher suites in the ClientHello message, grouped by TLS version:
TLS 1.2 Cipher Suites:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites:
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
The Security Administrator can enable and disable individual ciphersuites as well as specify the preferred ordering of ciphersuites. The TOE conforms to RFC 5246, section 7.4.3 for key exchange.
The TSF supports the following algorithms and key sizes for authenticating itself to TLS clients and establishing keys:
RSA: 2048, 3072, and 4096-bit RSA keys.
ECDSA: secp256r1, secp384r1 or secp521r1 curves.
The TSF prefers the secp256r1 curve when selecting an ECDHE ciphersuite if the client indicates support for all three curves in the ClientHello message.
The TSF does not support session resumption.
When acting as a server, the TSF listens on port 443 for HTTPS connections. The TSF uses HTML over HTTPS to present the administrative users with a secure management interface. The TSF uses TLS to provide a secure connection between the TSF and remote Security Administrators.
The TOE does not support the use of Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in TLSv1.3, making out-of-band provisioning of PSKs not possible in the evaluated configuration.

SFR statement for FIA_AFL.1:
FIA_AFL.1.1
The TSF shall detect when an Administrator configurable positive integer within [3 to 10] unsuccessful authentication attempts occur related to Administrators attempting to authenticate remotely using a password.
FIA_AFL.1.2
When the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts has been met, the TSF shall [prevent the offending Administrator from successfully establishing a remote session using any authentication method that involves a password until an Administrator defined time period has elapsed].

--------------------

TSS text for FIA_AFL.1:
The Security Administrator can configure the number of unsuccessful login attempts allowed for a remote administrator before a lockout occurs and can set the duration of the lockout. The number of attempts can be configured within a range of 3 to 10. The lockout duration can be configured between 3 and 999 minutes.
If a Security Administrator enters an incorrect password the configured number of times, the administrator is locked out and cannot log in through any remote interface on the TOE. Once the lockout duration has expired, the administrator is permitted to authenticate to the TOE again.
Lockouts are not enforced on the TOE’s local console interface. This ensures that authentication failures do not result in a situation where no administrator access is available.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FIA_AFL.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it contains a description, for each supported method for remote administrative actions, of how successive unsuccessful authentication attempts are detected and tracked. The TSS shall also describe the method by which the remote administrator is prevented from successfully logging on to the TOE, and the actions necessary to restore this ability.
Ans#1 for FIA_AFL.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_AFL.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_AFL.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FIA_AFL.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to confirm that the TOE ensures that authentication failures by remote administrators cannot lead to a situation where no administrator access is available, either permanently or temporarily (e.g. by providing local logon which is not subject to blocking).
Ans#2 for FIA_AFL.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_AFL.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_AFL.1>

Passwords shall be able to be composed of any combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and the following special characters: [“!”, “@”, “#”, “$”, “%”, “^”, “&”, “*”, “(“, “)”]
Minimum password length shall be configurable to between [10] and [15] characters.

--------------------

TSS text for FIA_PMG_EXT.1:
The TSF supports administrator password composition to include any combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and the following special characters “!”, “@”, “#”, “$”, “%”, “^”, “&”, “*”, “(“, “)” with the password length configurable by the administrator to a minimum range of 10 to 15 characters. The TOE supports a maximum password length of up to 999 characters.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FIA_PMG_EXT.1: The evaluator shall check that the TSS:
lists the supported special character(s) for the composition of administrator passwords.
to ensure that the minimum_password_length parameter is configurable by a Security Administrator.
lists the range of values supported for the minimum_password_length parameter. The listed range shall include the value of 15.
Ans#1 for FIA_PMG_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_PMG_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_PMG_EXT.1>
