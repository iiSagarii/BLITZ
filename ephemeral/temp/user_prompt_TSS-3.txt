SFR statement for FCS_CKM.4:
FCS_CKM.4.1
The TSF shall destroy cryptographic keys in accordance with a specified cryptographic key destruction method
For plaintext keys in volatile storage, the destruction shall be executed by a [single overwrite consisting of [zeroes]];
For plaintext keys in non-volatile storage, the destruction shall be executed by the invocation of an interface provided by a part of the TSF that [
logically addresses the storage location of the key and performs a [[3]-pass] overwrite consisting of [a pseudorandom pattern using the TSF’s RBG];
]
that meets the following: No Standard

--------------------

TSS text for FCS_CKM.4:
The TSF stores the following persistent keys on internal Hard Disk Drives in plaintext:
HTTPs/TLS Private Host Key – generated using the DRBG and FCS_CKM.1 or entered by the Security Administrator.
Syslog/TLS Private Client Key – generated using the DRBG and FCS_CKM.1 or entered by the Security Administrator.
The HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key are zeroized from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. 
The TSF zeroizes the HTTPs/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key on the hard disk drives by overwriting the file location with data from /dev/random three times. Each overwrite calls /dev/random ensuring that a different pseudo random pattern is used each time.

The TSF stores loads the persistent keys into RAM when they are used and the TSF also stores the following ephemeral keys in RAM:
TLS Session keys – Established according to FCS_CKM.2 and derived using the TLS KDF
DRBG State – Derived from the entropy source

HTTPS/TLS keys are zeroized from RAM when the HTTP or Syslog process terminates.
The TLS Session keys are zeroized from RAM when the associated TLS session is terminated.
The DRBG state and all ephemeral keys are zeroized when the TSF is shutdown, suffers loss of power, or restarted. The TSF zeroizes keys in RAM by writing zeros to the memory location one time and performing a read verify to ensure that the memory location was set to all zeros. If the read verify fails, the TSF repeats the zeroization process.
The above key destruction methods apply to all configurations and circumstances, except one. The only situation where the key destruction may be prevented would be if the system suffers a crash or loss of power. This situation only impacts on the keys that are stored on the disk. Since the TOE is inaccessible in this situation, administrative zeroization cannot be performed. However, all keys on the disk are protected because the TOE enables full disk encryption by default.
The TOE does not store any keys in non-plaintext form.
For additional details on Cryptographic Key Destruction, please refer to Section 6.2.

TSS-requirement#1 for FCS_CKM.4: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys (describing the origin and storage location of each), all relevant key destruction situations (e.g. factory reset or device wipe function, disconnection of trusted channels, key change as part of a secure channel protocol), and the destruction method used in each case. For the purpose of this Evaluation Activity the relevant keys are those keys that are relied upon to support any of the SFRs in the Security Target. The evaluator shall confirm that the description of keys and storage locations is consistent with the functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys for the TOE-specific secure channels and protocols, or that support FPT_APW.EXT.1 and FPT_SKP_EXT.1, are accounted for). In particular, if a TOE claims not to store plaintext keys in non-volatile memory, then the evaluator shall check that this is consistent with the operation of the TOE.

TSS-requirement#2 for FCS_CKM.4: The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS identifies how the TOE destroys keys stored as plaintext in non-volatile memory, and that the description includes identification and description of the interfaces that the TOE uses to destroy keys (e.g., file system APIs, key store APIs).

TSS-requirement#3 for FCS_CKM.4: Note that where selections involve ‘destruction of reference’ (for volatile memory) or ‘invocation of an interface’ (for non-volatile memory) then the relevant interface definition is examined by the evaluator to ensure that the interface supports the selection(s) and description in the TSS. In the case of nonvolatile memory, the evaluator includes in their examination the relevant interface description for each media type on which plaintext keys are stored. The presence of OS-level and storage device-level swap and cache files is not examined in the current version of the Evaluation Activity.

TSS-requirement#4 for FCS_CKM.4: Where the TSS identifies keys that are stored in a non-plaintext form, the evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies the encryption method and the key-encrypting-key used, and that the key-encrypting-key is either itself stored in an encrypted form or that it is destroyed by a method included under FCS_CKM.4.
Ans#4 for FCS_CKM.4: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FCS_CKM.4 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FCS_CKM.4>
TSS-requirement#5 for FCS_CKM.4: The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further discussion in the Guidance Documentation section below). Note that reference may be made to the Guidance Documentation for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or delayed.

TSS-requirement#6 for FCS_CKM.4: Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any CSP” to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.
