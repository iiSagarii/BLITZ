SFR statement for FTA_SSL_EXT.1:
FTA_SSL_EXT.1.1
The TSF Shall, for local interactive sessions, [
terminate the session]
after a Security Administrator-specified time period of inactivity

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1:
The TOE acts as a server for remote sessions accessed through the management interface. User sessions can be terminated by users. The Security Administrator can set the TOE so that local and remote sessions are terminated after a Security Administrator-configured period of inactivity.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_SSL_EXT.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details whether local administrative session locking or termination is supported and the related inactivity time period settings.
Ans#1 for FTA_SSL_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1>

SFR statement for FTA_TAB.1:
FTA_TAB.1.1
Before establishing a an administrative user session the TSF shall display a Security Administrator-specified advisory notice and consent warning message regarding unauthorised use of the TOE.
Trusted Path/Channels (FTP)

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_TAB.1:
The TSF enables Security Administrators to configure an access banner provided with the authentication prompt. The banner can provide warnings against unauthorized access to the TOE as well as any other information that the Security Administrator wishes to communicate. The TSF presents the access banner prior to authentication when a user connects to the remote web UI or local console CLI described in the FIA_UIA_EXT.1, FIA_UAU_EXT.2 description.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_TAB.1: The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that it details each administrative method of access (local and/or remote) available to the Security Administrator (e.g., serial port, SSH, HTTPS).
Ans#1 for FTA_TAB.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FTA_TAB.1: The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that all administrative methods of access available to the Security Administrator are listed and that the TSS states that the TOE is displaying an advisory notice and a consent warning message for each administrative method of access. The advisory notice and the consent warning message might be different for different administrative methods of access and might be configured during initial configuration (e.g. via configuration file).
Ans#2 for FTA_TAB.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1>

SFR statement for FTP_ITC.1:
FTP_ITC.1.1
The TSF shall be capable of using [TLS] to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and another trusted IT product authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server, [no other capabilities] that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data.
FTP_ITC.1.2
The TSF shall permit [the TSF, another trusted IT product, the authorized IT entities] to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
FTP_ITC.1.3
The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for [audit server communications].

--------------------

TSS text for FTP_ITC.1:
The TSF communicates with the external syslog server using Syslog over TLS with Authentication as described in the descriptions of FAU_STG_EXT.1 and FCS_TLSC_EXT.2. The TSF initiates the trusted channel with the Syslog server, ensuring assured identification of the Syslog server based on the X.509 certificates.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that, for all communications with authorized IT entities identified in the requirement, each secure communication mechanism is identified in terms of the allowed protocols for that IT entity, whether the TOE acts as a server or a client, and the method of assured identification of the non-TSF endpoint.
Ans#1 for FTP_ITC.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall also confirm that all secure communication mechanisms are described in sufficient detail to allow the evaluator to match them to the cryptographic protocol Security Functional Requirements listed in the ST.
Ans#2 for FTP_ITC.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1>
