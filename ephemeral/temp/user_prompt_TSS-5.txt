--------------------

TSS text for FCS_TLSC_EXT.1:
The TSF implements a TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 client to secure communications with the Syslog server. The TSF supports and proposes the following ciphersuites in the ClientHello Message:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
The Security Administrator can configure the TSF, so it only accepts TLSv1.2 connections for server and client communications. The Security Administrator can enable and disable individual ciphersuites as well as specifying the preferred ordering of ciphersuites.
The TSF establishes reference identifiers for the remote server as follows:
When the server is specified using a domain name, the TSF verifies that the domain name matches a Subject Alternative Name DNS Name field in the certificate using exact or wildcard matching specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 2818. If the certificate does not contain any Subject Alternative Name fields, the TSF matches the domain name against the Common Name in the certificate.
When the server is specified using an IP address, the TSF verifies that the IP address exactly matches a Subject Alterative Name IP Address field in the certificate using the rules specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 2818. If the certificate does not contain any Subject Alternative Name fields, the TSF matches the IP address against the Common Name in the certificate.
When the reference identifier is an IP address, the TOE converts the IP address to a binary representation in network byte order. IPv4 addresses are converted directly from decimal to binary as specified in RFC 3986. The TOE compares the binary IP address against all the IP Address entries in the Subject Alternative Name.
The TOE does not support using IPv6 addresses as a reference identifier.
The TSF does support wildcards but does not support certificate pinning and determines if the certificate is valid for the specified server based on the DNS name or IP address of the server. Wildcards are supported only at the left-most label of the identifier.
In either instance, the TSF will not establish the connection if the peer certificate does not successfully authenticate the peer according to X.509 authentication.
The TSF supports the following Supported Groups in the ClientHello message:
secp256r1
secp384r1
secp521r1
The TOE automatically sends the Supported Groups extension when an ECDHE ciphersuite is selected, and this behavior does not require administrator intervention.
The TSF supports the signature_algorithms_extension as defined in TLS 1.2 and later versions. The extension is included in the ClientHello message with the following set of signature algorithms:
rsa_pkcs1 with sha256
rsa_pkcs1with sha384
rsa_pkcs1 with sha512
ecdsa_secp256r1 with sha256
ecdsa_secp384r1 with sha384
ecdsa_secp521r1 with sha512
rsa_pss_rsae with sha256
rsa_pss_rsae with sha384
rsa_pss_rsae with sha512
rsa_pss_pss with sha256
rsa_pss_pss with sha384
The device presents the signature_algorithms extension in the ClientHello message by default and it cannot be configured.
The TSF supports TLS with mutual authentication using X509v3 certificates to secure communications with the Syslog server. When the Syslog server sends the Certificate Request message, the TSF replies with a Client Certificate message. The Client Certificate message includes the certificate that the Security Administrator configured to authenticate to the Syslog server.
The TOE does not support the use of Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in TLSv1.3, making out-of-band provisioning of PSKs not possible in the evaluated configuration.

The TSS shall describe the discovery process and highlight how the reference identifier is supplied to the “joining” component. Where the secure channel is being used between components of a distributed TOE for FPT_ITT.1 and the ST author selected attributes from RFC 5280, the evaluator shall ensure the TSS describes which attribute type, or combination of attributes types, are used by the client to match the presented identifier with the configured identifier. The evaluator shall ensure the TSS presents an argument how the attribute type, or combination of attribute types, uniquely identify the remote TOE component; and the evaluator shall verify the attribute type, or combination of attribute types, is sufficient to support unique identification of the maximum supported number of TOE components.

If TLS 1.2 is claimed and DHE ciphers are claimed, then the TSS must also specify whether the TOE is capable of negotiating DHE ciphers and whether the TOE client will terminate if an unsupported DHE parameter set is returned in the Server Key Exchange or whether all valid server-generated DHE parameters are accepted.
