--------------------

TSS text for FAU_STG_EXT.1:
The TOE is a standalone TOE. The TOE maintains three separate log files Events, User Access, and Admin Access. By default, the TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 500 MB. The TSF divides the local audit storage between two audit files (active and inactive). When the current audit file reaches capacity; the TSF overwrites the inactive log file (if present). If the inactive log file is not present, then the TOE creates a new log file, switches logging to the new log file, and generates an audit log indicating that a log file reached capacity.
The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion though the restrictive administrative interfaces. The filesystem of the TSF is not exposed to the administrative user over the HTTPs GUI or the local CLI. The administrative user must be positively identified and authenticated prior to being allowed to clear the local audit log or change audit settings.
The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using either TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3. Logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time. The logs are also stored locally in case the connection to the remote syslog server cannot be established. The trusted channel with the Syslog server is described in greater detail in the FCS_TLSC_EXT.2 description.
The TSF implements local logging by maintaining a log file of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles. The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB.

SFR statement for FCS_CKM.2:
FCS_CKM.2.1
The TSF shall perform cryptographic key establishment in accordance with a specified cryptographic key establishment method: [
RSA-based key establishment schemes that meet the following: RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 as specified in Section 7.2 of RFC 3447, 8017, “Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2”;
Elliptic curve-based key establishment schemes that meet the following: NIST Special Publication 800-56A Revision 3, “Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography”
] that meets the following: [assignment: list of standards].

--------------------

TSS text for FCS_CKM.2:
The TSF uses both elliptic curve-based and RSA-based key establishment in support of TLS. When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with a server certificate containing an ECDSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3
For syslog server, The TSF acts as the client during communication with the Syslog server. The key establishment scheme selection depends on the negotiated TLS ciphersuite:
For ECDHE ciphersuites, the TSF utilizes ECDHE.
For other TLS ciphersuites, the TSF employs RSA-based key establishment.
See FCS_TLS* description below for more details.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FCS_CKM.2: The evaluator shall ensure that the supported key establishment schemes correspond to the key generation schemes identified in FCS_CKM.1.1. If the ST specifies more than one scheme, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it identifies the usage for each scheme. It is sufficient to provide the scheme, SFR, and service in the TSS. The intent of this activity is to be able to identify the scheme being used by each service. This would mean, for example, one way to document scheme usage could be as shown in the table below. The information provided in this example does not necessarily have to be included as a table but can be presented in other ways as long as the necessary data is available.
