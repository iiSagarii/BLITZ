The HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key are zeroized from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. The TSF zeroizes the HTTPs/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key on the hard disk drives by overwriting the file location with data from /dev/random three times. Each overwrite calls /dev/random ensuring that a different pseudo random pattern is used each time.

The TLS Session keys are zeroized from RAM when the associated TLS session is terminated. The DRBG state and all ephemeral keys are zeroized when the TSF is shutdown, suffers loss of power, or restarted.

The only situation where the key destruction may be prevented would be if the system suffers a crash or loss of power. This situation only impacts on the keys that are stored on the disk.
