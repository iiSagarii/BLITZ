TSS text for FMT_SMF.1:
The TSF implements the Security Administrator role to authorized administrators of the TOE. The TSF allows the Security Administrators to administer the TSF via CLI through a serial cable connected to the TOE and a web UI over a remote HTTPS channel. The TSF permissions restrict access to these management functions to users that have been identified, authenticated, and authorized with the Security Administrator role. 
The web UI allow the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions:
Verify/Install Firmware Updates
View/Edit settings for sending audit data to the Syslog Server
View/Edit the amount of space allocated Local Audit storage
Clear/Delete Local Audit records
View/Edit enabled TLS versions
View/Edit enabled TLS cipher suites
View/Edit X.509 Certificates
Generate and configure cryptographic keys used to identify the TOE
Configure cryptographic keys used to authenticate users
View/Edit the TOE access banner
View/Edit the session inactivity timeout
View/Edit authentication failure parameters
Set user account passwords
Modify system time
Configure audit behavior
Modify the behavior of the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity.
The local console allows the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions:
Verify firmware update
Set user account passwords
The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any of these functions to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.
The TSF implements local logging by maintaining a log file of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles. The minimum storage size allocated for audit records is 1 MB.

SFR statement for FMT_SMR.2:
FMT_SMR.2.1
The TSF shall maintain the roles:
Security Administrator
FMT_SMR.2.2
The TSF shall be able to associate users with roles.
FMT_SMR.2.3
The TSF shall ensure that the conditions
The Security Administrator role shall be able to administer the TOE remotely
are satisfied.
Protection of the TSF (FPT)

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_SMR.2:
Individual accountability is maintained by ensuring that every user is assigned a unique account with specific roles that determine their access level and privileges.
The following user roles are supported by the TOE:
System Administrator: Who has full read and write access to Admin UI pages.
Read-only-Administrators: System Administrator can enable these roles whose write access is restricted and can only read admin UI.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FMT_SMR.2: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details the TOE supported roles and any restrictions of the roles involving administration of the TOE (e.g. if local administrators and remote administrators have different privileges or if several types of administrators with different privileges are supported by the TOE).

SFR statement for FPT_APW_EXT.1:
FPT_APW_EXT.1.1
The TSF shall store administrative passwords in non-plaintext form.
FPT_APW_EXT.1.2
The TSF shall prevent the reading of plaintext administrative passwords.

--------------------

TSS text for FPT_APW_EXT.1:
The TSF does not store plaintext passwords. The TSF stores the SHA-256
hash of each users’ password. Additionally, the TSF does not provide a
user interface to view the password hashes.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FPT_APW_EXT.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details all authentication data that are subject to this requirement, and the method used to obscure the plaintext password data when stored. The TSS shall also detail passwords are stored in such a way that they are unable to be viewed through an interface designed specifically for that purpose, as outlined in the application note.
Ans#1 for FPT_APW_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_APW_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_APW_EXT.1>
