SFR statement for FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1:
FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.1
The TSF shall implement the HTTPS protocol that complies with RFC 2818.
FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1.2
The TSF shall implement the HTTPS protocol using TLS.

--------------------

TSS text for FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1:
The TSF implements the server and client sides of the HTTPs protocol according to RFC 2818 by using a TLS session to secure the HTTP session. All MUST and REQUIRED statement within RFC 2818 are followed.

The TSF supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 for HTTPs/TLS. If the TSF receives a ClientHello message that requests TLSv1.1 or earlier, the TSF sends a fatal handshake_failure message and terminates the connection. When configured with an RSA certificate, the TSF supports the following TLSv1.2 ciphersuites for connections to the TOE:
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

When configured with an ECDSA certificate, the TSF supports the following TLSv1.2 ciphersuites for connections to the TOE:
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

The TSF supports the following TLSv1.3 ciphersuites for connections to the TOE:
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

The TOE conforms to RFC 5246, section 7.4.3 for key exchange.
When the TSF selects an ECDHE ciphersuite, it sends the client secp256r1, secp384r1 or secp521r1 key agreement parameters. The TSF prefers secp256r1 if the client indicates support for all three curves in the ClientHello message.
