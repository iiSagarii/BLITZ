TSS-requirement#1 for FAU_GEN.1: For the administrative task of generating/importing, changing, or deleting of cryptographic keys as defined in FAU_GEN.1.1c, the TSS should identify what information is logged to identify the relevant key.
Ans#1 for FAU_GEN.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FAU_GEN.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FAU_GEN.1 >.

This includes that the evaluator shall confirm that all components defined as generating audit information for a particular SFR should also contribute to that SFR as defined in the mapping of SFRs to TOE components, and that the audit records generated by each component cover all the SFRs that it implements.

SFR statement for FAU_STG.1:
FAU_STG.1.1
The TSF shall protect the stored audit records in the audit trail from unauthorized deletion.
FAU_STG.1.2
The TSF shall be able to prevent unauthorised modifications to the stored audit records in the audit trail.

--------------------

TSS text for FAU_STG.1:
The TOE is a standalone TOE. The TOE maintains three separate log files Events, User Access, and Admin Access. By default, the TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 500 MB. The TSF divides the local audit storage between two audit files (active and inactive). When the current audit file reaches capacity; the TSF overwrites the inactive log file (if present). If the inactive log file is not present, then the TOE creates a new log file, switches logging to the new log file, and generates an audit log indicating that a log file reached capacity.
The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion though the restrictive administrative interfaces. The filesystem of the TSF is not exposed to the administrative user over the HTTPs GUI or the local CLI. The administrative user must be positively identified and authenticated prior to being allowed to clear the local audit log or change audit settings.
The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using either TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3. Logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time. The logs are also stored locally in case the connection to the remote syslog server cannot be established. The trusted channel with the Syslog server is described in greater detail in the FCS_TLSC_EXT.2 description.
The TSF implements local logging by maintaining a log file of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles. The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FAU_STG.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the amount of audit data that are stored locally and how these records are protected against unauthorized modification or deletion.
Ans#1 for FAU_STG.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FAU_STG.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FAU_STG.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FAU_STG.1: The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes the conditions that must be met for authorized deletion of audit records.
Ans#2 for FAU_STG.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FAU_STG.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FAU_STG.1>
TSS-requirement#3 for FAU_STG.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes to which TOE components this SFR applies and how local storage is implemented among the different TOE components (e.g. every TOE component does its own local storage or the data is sent to another TOE component for central local storage of all audit events).
Ans#3 for FAU_STG.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FAU_STG.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FAU_STG.1>
