SFR statement for FPT_TUD_EXT.1:
FPT_TUD_EXT.1.1
The TSF shall provide Security Administrators the ability to query the currently executing version of the TOE firmware/software and [no other TOE firmware/software version].
FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2
The TSF shall provide Security Administrators the ability to manually initiate updates to TOE firmware/software and [no other update mechanism].

The TSF shall provide means to authenticate firmware/software updates to the TOE using a [digital signature] prior to installing those updates.
TOE Access (FTA)

--------------------

TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1:
The TSF allows the Security Administrator to install software updates. The Security Administrator obtains candidate updates by downloading them on a remote workstation from the Ivanti Secure website. When the Security Administrator uploads a firmware update using HTTPS webUI, the TSF performs an RSA 2048 SHA-512 digital signature verification of the update using the Ivanti Secure firmware update public key. The public key is distributed as part of the firmware package. Ivanti Secure retains control over the private key used to sign firmware updates. If the signature check is successful, the TSF installs the update. If the signature check detects tampering with the update and/or signature, the TSF presents the user with an error message and discards the update.
The TSF allows the Security Administrator to view the currently running version of firmware from the System Maintenance > Platform page of the web UI.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describe how to query the currently active version. If a trusted update can be installed on the TOE with a delayed activation, the TSS shall describe how and when the inactive version becomes active. The evaluator shall verify this description.
Ans#1 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes all TSF software update mechanisms for updating the system firmware and software (for simplicity the term 'software' will be used in the following although the requirements apply to firmware and software). The evaluator shall verify that the description includes a digital signature verification of the software of the software before installation and that installation fails if the verification fails.
Ans#2 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1>
TSS-requirement#3 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the method by which the digital signature is verified to include how the candidate updates are obtained, the processing associated with verifying the digital signature of the update, and the actions that take place for both successful and unsuccessful signature verification.
Ans#3 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1>
TSS-requirement#4 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: If the options ‘support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ are chosen from the selection in FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS explains what actions are involved in automatic checking or automatic updating by the TOE, respectively.
Ans#4 for FPT_TUD_EXT.1: If the options ‘support automatic checking for updates’ or ‘support automatic updates’ are chosen from the selection in FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2, the evaluator verified that the TSS <insert the TSS section number or tow identifier in the TSS table> explains what actions are involved in automatic checking or automatic updating by the TOE, respectively.
The relevant information is found in the following section(s): TOE Summary Specification <SFR>.
Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1>
TSS-requirement#5 for FPT_TST_EXT.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes how all TOE components are updated, that it describes all mechanisms that support continuous proper functioning of the TOE during update (when applying updates separately to individual TOE components) and how verification of the signature or checksum is performed for each TOE component. Alternatively, this description can be provided in the guidance documentation. In that case the evaluator should examine the guidance documentation instead.
Ans#5 for FPT_TST_EXT.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FPT_TUD_EXT.1>

SFR statement for FTA_SSL.3:
FTA_SSL.3.1
The TSF shall terminate a remote interactive session after a Security Administrator-configurable time interval of session inactivity.

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_SSL.3:
The TOE acts as a server for remote sessions accessed through the management interface. User sessions can be terminated by users. The Security Administrator can set the TOE so that local and remote sessions are terminated after a Security Administrator-configured period of inactivity.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_SSL.3: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details the administrative remote session termination and the related inactivity time period.
Ans#1 for FTA_SSL.3: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_SSL.3 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_SSL.3>

SFR statement for FTA_SSL.4:
FTA_SSL.4.1
The TSF shall allow user Administrator-initiated termination of the user’s Administrator’s own interactive session.

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_SSL.4:
The TOE acts as a server for remote sessions accessed through the management interface. User sessions can be terminated by users. The Security Administrator can set the TOE so that local and remote sessions are terminated after a Security Administrator-configured period of inactivity.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_SSL.4: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details how the remote administrative session (and if applicable the local administrative session) are terminated.
Ans#1 for FTA_SSL.4: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_SSL.4 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_SSL.4>
