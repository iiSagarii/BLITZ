SFR statement for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate:
FMT_MOF.1.1/ManualUpdate
The TSF shall restrict the ability to enable the function to perform manual updates to Security Administrators.

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate:
The TSF implements the Security Administrator role to authorized administrators of the TOE. The TSF allows the Security Administrators to administer the TSF via CLI through a serial cabled connected to the TOE and a web UI over a remote HTTPS channel. The TSF permissions restrict access to these management functions to users that have been identified, authenticated, and authorized with the Security Administrator role. The web UI and local console allow the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions:
Verify/Install Firmware Updates
View/Edit settings for sending audit data to the Syslog Server
View/Edit the amount of space allocated Local Audit storage
Clear/Delete Local Audit records
View/Edit enabled TLS versions
View/Edit enabled TLS ciphersuties
View/Edit X.509 Certificates
Generate and configure cryptographic keys used to identify the TOE
Configure cryptographic keys used to authenticate users
View/Edit the TOE access banner
View/Edit the session inactivity timeout
View/Edit authentication failure parameters
Set user account passwords
Modify system time
The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any of these functions to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.
The TOE provides a trust store to store certificates. The permissions on the trust store restrict access so that only Security Administrators can import or delete certificates from the trust store. Security Administrators can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. No other access to the trust store is allowed.

--------------------

Ans#1 for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate: For distributed TOEs see Section 5.1.4.1. [CPP_ND_V3.0E-SD]. There are no specific requirements for non-distributed TOEs.

FMT_MTD.1.1/CoreData
The TSF shall restrict the ability to manage the TSF data to Security Administrators.

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData:
The only functions accessible prior to authentication are the display of the configurable warning and consent banner and the automated response to ICMP echo messages with ICMP echo reply messages.
The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any of the functions to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.

Security Administrators can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. No other access to the trust store is allowed.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: For each administrative function identified in the guidance documentation that is accessible through an interface prior to administrator log-in, the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS details how the ability to manipulate the TSF data through these interfaces is disallowed for non-administrative users.
Ans#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData  here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData >
TSS-requirement#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: If the TOE supports handling of X.509v3 certificates and implements a trust store, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it contains sufficient information to describe how the ability to manage the TOE’s trust store is restricted.
Ans#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData >

TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys:
The TOE restricts the ability to manage TLS (session keys), and any
configured X.509 certificates (public and private key pairs) to security administrators via GUI.

--------------------

Ans#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys:  For distributed TOEs see Section 2.4.1.1.
TSS-requirement#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys: For non-distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall ensure the TSS lists the keys the Security Administrator is able to manage to include the options available (e.g. generating keys, importing keys, modifying keys or deleting keys) and how that how those operations are performed.
Ans#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys>
