SFR statement for FIA_UIA_EXT.1:
FIA_UIA_EXT.1.1
The TSF shall allow the following actions prior to requiring the non-TOE entity to initiate the identification and authentication process:
Display the warning banner in accordance with FTA_TAB.1;
[[Respond to ICMP Echo messages with an ICMP Echo Reply message]].
FIA_UIA_EXT.1.2
The TSF shall require each administrative user to be successfully identified and authenticated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that administrative user.
FIA_UIA_EXT.1.3
The TSF shall provide the following remote authentication mechanisms [Web GUI password] and local authentication mechanisms [password-based].
FIA_UIA_EXT.1.4
The TSF shall authenticate any administrative user’s claimed identity according to each authentication mechanism specified in FIA_UIA_EXT.1.3.

--------------------

TSS text for FIA_UIA_EXT.1:
The TSF utilizes HTTPS to secure a remote administration web UI session. When connecting over HTTPS, the TSF presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt; The Security Administrator using password authentication is considered authenticated if the username and the SHA-256 hash of the password matches the stored username and SHA-256 password hash. A successful authentication takes the user to the System Status page.
The TSF utilizes a local serial CLI which presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt. The Security Administrator is considered authenticated if the username and password provided match the credentials configured in the TSF. A successful login takes the user to the CLI menu.
Prior to successful identification and authentication, the TSF displays the TOE access banner specified in FTA_TAB.1 and responds to ICMP Echo messages with ICMP Echo Reply messages.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FIA_UIA_EXT.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes the logon process for remote authentication mechanism (e.g. SSH public key, Web GUI password, etc.) and optional local authentication mechanisms supported by the TOE. This description shall contain information pertaining to the credentials allowed/used, any protocol transactions that take place, and what constitutes a “successful logon”.
Ans#1 for FIA_UIA_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_UIA_EXT.1here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_UIA_EXT.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FIA_UIA_EXT.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes which actions are allowed before administrator identification and authentication. The description shall cover authentication and identification for local and remote TOE administration.

TSS-requirement#3 for FIA_UIA_EXT.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): For distributed TOEs the evaluator shall examine that the TSS details how Security Administrators are authenticated and identified by all TOE components. If not, all TOE components support authentication of Security Administrators according to FIA_UIA_EXT.1, the TSS shall describe how the overall TOE functionality is split between TOE components including how it is ensured that no unauthorized access to any TOE component can occur.

TSS-requirement#4 for FIA_UIA_EXT.1 (for DISTRIBUTED TOE): For distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes for each TOE component which actions are allowed before administrator identification and authentication. The description shall cover authentication and identification for remote TOE administration and optionally for local TOE administration if claimed by the ST author. For each TOE component that does not support authentication of Security Administrators according to FIA_UIA_EXT.1 the TSS shall describe any unauthenticated services/services that are supported by the component.

SFR statement for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev:
FIA_X509_EXT.1.1/Rev
The TSF shall validate certificates in accordance with the following rules:
RFC 5280 certificate validation and certification path validation supporting a minimum path length of three certificates.
The certification path must terminate with a trusted CA certificate designated as a trust anchor.
The TSF shall validate a certification path by ensuring that all CA certificates in the certification path contain the basicConstraints extension with the CA flag set to TRUE.
The TSF shall validate the revocation status of the certificate using [a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) as specified in RFC 5280 Section 6.3]
The TSF shall validate the extendedKeyUsage field according to the following rules:
Certificates used for trusted updates and executable code integrity verification shall have the Code Signing purpose (id-kp 3 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) in the extendedKeyUsage field.
Server certificates presented for DTLS/TLS shall have the Server Authentication purpose (id-kp 1 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the extendedKeyUsage field.
Client certificates presented for DTLS/TLS shall have the Client Authentication purpose (id-kp 2 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) in the extendedKeyUsage field.
OCSP certificates presented for OCSP responses shall have the OCSP Signing purpose (id-kp 9 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) in the extendedKeyUsage field.
FIA_X509_EXT.1.2/Rev
The TSF shall only treat a certificate as a CA certificate if the basicConstraints extension is present and the CA flag is set to TRUE.

--------------------

TSS text for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev:
When a certificate is used (to identify the TSF or identify an external entity to the TSF), the TSF verifies certificates by checking the following:
The current date between the “Valid from” and “Valid to” dates.
The certificate is not listed on the CRL. If the TSF has a cached response that has not expired, the TSF uses the cached response in lieu of querying the CRL server.
The certificate chain is valid:
Each certificate in the certificate chain passes the checks described in #1 and #2.
Each certificate (other than the first certificate) in the certificate chain has the Subject Type=CA flag set.
Each certificate is signed by:
a certificate in the certificate chain, or
a trusted root CA that has been installed in the TSF
The TSF verifies the validity of a certificate in the following situations:
Syslog Server Certificate Verification: When the TSF connects to a Syslog server, it verifies the server’s certificate to confirm its authenticity and validity.
Client Certificate Authentication: When the TSF uses its client certificate to authenticate with the Syslog server, it verifies that its own certificate is valid and correctly issued.
If the Security Administrator loads a certificate with a Subject Type=CA, the TSF does not validate the certificate path.
The rules for extendedKeyUsage fields are followed in all instances; Server Authentication purpose is checked for all presented Server certificates.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV: The evaluator shall ensure the TSS describes where the check of validity of the certificates takes place, and that the TSS identifies any of the rules for extendedKeyUsage fields (in FIA_X509_EXT.1.1) that are not supported by the TOE (i.e. where the ST is therefore claiming that they are trivially satisfied). It is expected that revocation checking is performed when a certificate is used in an authentication step and when performing trusted updates (if selected).
Ans#1 for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV>
TSS-requirement#2 for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV: The TSS shall describe when revocation checking is performed and on what certificates. If the revocation checking during authentication is handled differently depending on whether a full certificate chain or only a leaf certificate is being presented, any differences must be summarized in the TSS section and explained in the Guidance.
Ans#2 for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV>
