SFR statement for FTP_ITC.1:
FTP_ITC.1.1
The TSF shall be capable of using [SSH] to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and another trusted IT product authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server, [no other capabilities] that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data.
FTP_ITC.1.2
The TSF shall permit [the TSF, the authorized IT entities] to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
FTP_ITC.1.3
The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for [MACsec communication].

--------------------

TSS text for FTP_ITC.1:
The TOE supports SSHv2 for trusted channel implementation to syslog server. Additionally, the TOE implements the MACsec protocol for the protection of layer 2 communications between itself and authenticated MACsec peers. The TOE provides trusted channels using SSHv2 protocol which ensures the confidentiality and integrity of communication with the remote audit server (syslog server). The TOE acts as an SSH client while initiating a connection with the configured syslog server. 

Export of audit information to a secure, remote server is achieved by setting up an event trace monitor that sends event log messages by using NETCONF over SSH to the remote system event logging server. The SSHv2 protocol ensures that the data transmitted over a SSH session cannot be disclosed or altered by using the encryption and integrity mechanisms of the protocol with the FIPS cryptographic module.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that, for all communications with authorized IT entities identified in the requirement, each secure communication mechanism is identified in terms of the allowed protocols for that IT entity, whether the TOE acts as a server or a client, and the method of assured identification of the non-TSF endpoint.
Ans#1 for FTP_ITC.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall also confirm that all secure communication mechanisms are described in sufficient detail to allow the evaluator to match them to the cryptographic protocol Security Functional Requirements listed in the ST.
Ans#2 for FTP_ITC.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1>

FTP_ITC.1.1/MACSEC
The TSF shall provide a communication channel between itself and a MACsec peer that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure.
FTP_ITC.1.2/MACSEC
The TSF shall permit [the TSF, another trusted IT product] to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
FTP_ITC.1.3/MACSEC
The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for [communications with MACsec peers that require the use of MACsec].

SFR statement for FTP_TRP.1/Admin:
FTP_TRP.1.1/Admin
The TSF shall be capable of using [SSH] to provide a communication path between itself and authorized remote Administrators users that is logically distinct from other communication paths and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the communicated data from disclosure and provides detection of modification of the channel data.
FTP_TRP.1.2/Admin
The TSF shall permit remote Administrators users to initiate communication via the trusted path.
FTP_TRP.1.3/Admin
The TSF shall require the use of the trusted path for initial Administrator authentication and all remote administration actions.

--------------------

TSS text for FTP_TRP.1/Admin:
The TOE supports remote administration using SSH. A trusted path is provided by the TOE using SSHv2 protocol between itself and remote administrators so that the contents of administrative sessions are protected against unauthorized disclosure or modification.
Remote administrators can initiate communication to the TOE’s CLI through the SSH tunnel created by the SSH session. Assured identification is guaranteed by using password or public key-based authentication mechanisms. The SSHv2 protocol ensures that the data transmitted over a SSH session cannot be disclosed or altered by using the encryption and integrity mechanisms of the protocol with the FIPS cryptographic module.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTP_TRP.1/Admin: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that the methods of remote TOE administration are indicated, along with how those communications are protected.
Ans#1 for FTP_TRP.1/Admin: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_TRP.1/Admin here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_TRP.1/Admin>
TSS-requirement#2 for FTP_TRP.1/Admin: The evaluator shall also confirm that all protocols listed in the TSS in support of TOE administration are consistent with those specified in the requirement, and are included in the requirements in the ST.
Ans#2 for FTP_TRP.1/Admin: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_TRP.1/Admin here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_TRP.1/Admin>
