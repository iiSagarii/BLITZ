      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF restricts the ability to modify the behavior of audit-related functions to Security Administrators. For the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity, Security Administrators can configure the destination address, TLS protocol, and source port for communication with an external syslog server. Audit forwarding is automatically enabled when this configuration is present and automatically disabled when the configuration is removed; there is no separate control to explicitly enable or disable the feature. With respect to the handling of audit data, Security Administrators have control over local audit management functions, including the ability to clear existing logs and configure the maximum log size. When the local audit storage space becomes full, the TOE automatically overwrites the oldest audit records. This log overwrite behavior is fixed and cannot be configured by the Security Administrator."
