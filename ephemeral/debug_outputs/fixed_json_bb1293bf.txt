The certificate is not listed on the CRL. If the TSF has a cached response that has not expired, the TSF uses the cached response in lieu of querying the CRL server. The certificate chain is valid if: Each certificate in the certificate chain passes the checks described in #1 and #2. Each certificate (other than the first certificate) in the certificate chain has the Subject Type=CA flag set. Each certificate is signed by: a certificate in the certificate chain, or a trusted root CA that has been installed in the TSF. The TSF verifies the validity of a certificate in the following situations: Intermediate CA certificate: When an Intermediate CA certificate is uploaded to the TOE\\'s trust store, the TSF verifies its authenticity and validity, including revocation status, before accepting it into the trust anchor store. Syslog Server Certificate Verification: When the TSF connects to a Syslog server, it verifies the server\\'s certificate to confirm its authenticity and validity, including revocation status, before establishing a trusted connection. Client Certificate Authentication: When the TSF uses its client certificate to authenticate with the Syslog server, it verifies that its own certificate is valid and correctly issued. If the Client Authentication EKU is absent, the TSF rejects the certificate during upload and does not allow it to be used for mutual authentication with the Syslog server. If the Security Administrator loads a certificate with a Subject Type=CA, the TSF does not validate the certificate path. X.509 certificates are not used for trusted updates. The rules for extendedKeyUsage fields are followed in all instances; Server Authentication purpose is checked for all presented Server certificates. The TOE\\'s trust anchor store is expected to include both CA and Intermediate CA certificates. When an Intermediate CA certificate is uploaded to the TOE\\'s trust store, the TOE performs revocation checking on that certificate as part of the validation process. During authentication, the TOE performs revocation checking only on the leaf certificate, regardless of whether a full certificate chain or only the leaf certificate is presented. No different handling is applied based on the structure of the certificate chain."
