The communication includes authentication, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs transmitted to the syslog server. The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3, supporting mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. The TSF ensures assured identification of the syslog server by verifying its certificate using domain name or IP address matching, as per RFC 2818.",
