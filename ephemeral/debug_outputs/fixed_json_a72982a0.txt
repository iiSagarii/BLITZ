The TSF verifies the domain name against the Subject Alternative Name DNS Name field or the Common Name if Subject Alternative Name fields are not present. For IP addresses, the TSF verifies against the Subject Alternative Name IP Address field or the Common Name. The TSF verifies the validity of the certificate as described in FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev. The TSF presents its own certificate configured specifically for authentication to the Syslog server. If the TSF cannot contact the CRL server or the server does not respond, the TSF logs the failure and considers the certificate valid."

For the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity, Security Administrators can configure the destination address, TLS protocol, and source port for communication with an external syslog server. Audit forwarding is automatically enabled when this configuration is present and automatically disabled when the configuration is removed. With respect to the handling of audit data, Security Administrators have control over local audit management functions, including the ability to clear existing logs and configure the maximum log size. When the local audit storage space becomes full, the TOE automatically overwrites the oldest audit records."
