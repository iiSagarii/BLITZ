The Security Administrator obtains candidate updates by downloading them on a remote workstation from the Ivanti Secure website. When the Security Administrator uploads a firmware update using HTTPS webUI, the TSF performs an RSA 2048 SHA-512 digital signature verification of the update using the Ivanti Secure firmware update public key. The public key is distributed as part of the firmware package. Ivanti Secure retains control over the private key used to sign firmware updates. If the signature check is successful, the TSF installs the update. If the signature check detects tampering with the update and/or signature, the TSF presents the user with an error message and discards the update."
