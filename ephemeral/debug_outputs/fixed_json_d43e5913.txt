The local and Remote administrative sessions can be terminated by users using the instructions provided below: To log out of the remote web GUI, go to the user type icon on the top right of the screen and click logout. To exit a local console session, choose option 11 Exit Serial Console Session on the local serial console. The Security Administrator can set the TOE so that local and remote sessions are terminated after a Security Administrator-configured period of inactivity. The default inactivity timeout is 10 minutes, and the configurable range is from 5 to 9999999 minutes. Although the inactivity timeout is configurable within a wide range, it is strongly recommended that the Security Administrator configure the timeout value between 5 to 15 minutes."

The communication includes authentication, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs transmitted to the syslog server. The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3, supporting mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. Logs are sent to the syslog server in real-time and stored locally if the connection is unavailable. The TSF ensures assured identification of the syslog server by verifying its certificate using domain name or IP address matching, as per RFC 2818. This verification is supported for both the CN and SAN fields in the server certificate. The implementation of Syslog over TLS and the associated secure communications are described in more detail in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 and FCS_TLSC_EXT.2."
