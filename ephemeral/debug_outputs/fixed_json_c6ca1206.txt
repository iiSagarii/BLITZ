The TSS text provided satisfies all the requirements for each SFR. Here's the detailed evaluation:

1. **For FPT_TUD_EXT.1 TSS-requirement#1**: The TSS text adequately explains how to query the current version via the web GUI and local console.

2. **For FPT_TUD_EXT.1 TSS-requirement#2**: The TSS describes updates via HTTPS and digital signature verification, meeting the requirement.

3. **For FPT_TUD_EXT.1 TSS-requirement#3**: The process of digital signature verification is clearly detailed in the TSS.

4. **For FPT_TUD_EXT.1 TSS-requirement#4 and #5**: These are not applicable as automatic updates aren't selected and it's a standalone TOE.

5. **For FTA_SSL.3 TSS-requirement#1**: The TSS explains session termination and inactivity timeouts, satisfying the requirement.

6. **For FTA_SSL.4 TSS-requirement#1**: The TSS describes both remote and local session termination, fulfilling the requirement.

Overall, all TSS text meets the respective requirements with no gaps identified.
