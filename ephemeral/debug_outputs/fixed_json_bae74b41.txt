Audit forwarding is automatically enabled when this configuration is present and automatically disabled when the configuration is removed; there is no separate control to explicitly enable or disable the feature. With respect to the handling of audit data, Security Administrators have control over local audit management functions, including the ability to clear existing logs and configure the maximum log size. When the local audit storage space becomes full, the TOE automatically overwrites the oldest audit records. This log overwrite behavior is fixed and cannot be configured by the Security Administrator."
