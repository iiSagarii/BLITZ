Once the set inactivity period is crossed the user would be logged out form the TOE and the session would be terminated. For each user session, the TOE maintains a count of clock cycles (provided by the system clock) since the last user activity. The count is reset each time the user performs any activity within the session. When the counter reaches the number of clock cycles equating to the configured period of inactivity, the user session is locked out."
