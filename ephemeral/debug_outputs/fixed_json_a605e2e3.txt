By default, the TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 1024 MB for hardware platforms and 200 MB for virtual platforms. The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion through the restrictive administrative interfaces. The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using either TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3. The TSF supports TLS with mutual authentication using X509v3 certificates to secure communications with the Syslog server. Logs are stored locally in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles.\".",
