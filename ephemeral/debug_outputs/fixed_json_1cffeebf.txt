SHA-256 integrity check of each executable file in the TSF using the pre-calculated hashes from the manifest file. The Cryptographic library test and the Firmware checks provide a high level of assurance that the firmware has not been tampered with and that the cryptographic algorithms are working properly. The Cryptographic library tests verify that each cryptographic algorithm specified in FCS_COP.1 requirements is passing a KAT. The KAT demonstrates that the algorithm is functioning properly by invoking the algorithm with hard coded keys and messages and comparing the result to a pre-computed, known to be correct value. The ECDSA PCT shows that the ECDSA algorithm is functioning properly by signing a known value with a known key and verifying that verifying the computed signature indicates that the signature is valid."
