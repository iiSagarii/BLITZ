The TSF allows the Security Administrators to administer the TSF via CLI through a serial cable connected to the TOE and a web UI over a remote HTTPS channel. The TSF permissions restrict access to these management functions to users that have been identified, authenticated, and authorized with the Security Administrator role. The web UI allow the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions: Verify/Install Firmware Updates, View/Edit settings for sending audit data to the Syslog Server, View/Edit the amount of space allocated Local Audit storage, Clear/Delete Local Audit records, View/Edit enabled TLS versions, View/Edit enabled TLS cipher suites, View/Edit X.509 Certificates, Generate and configure cryptographic keys used to identify the TOE, Configure cryptographic keys used to authenticate users, View/Edit the TOE access banner, View/Edit the session inactivity timeout, View/Edit authentication failure parameters, Set user account passwords, Modify system time, Configure audit behavior, Modify the behavior of the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity. The local console allows the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions: Verify firmware update, Set user account passwords."
