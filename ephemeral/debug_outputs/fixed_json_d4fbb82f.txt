When connecting over HTTPS, the TSF presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt; The Security Administrator using password authentication is considered authenticated if the username and the SHA-256 hash of the password matches the stored username and SHA-256 password hash. A successful authentication takes the user to the System Status page. The TSF utilizes a local serial CLI which presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt. The Security Administrator is considered authenticated if the username and password provided match the credentials configured in the TSF. A successful login takes the user to the CLI menu. Prior to successful identification and authentication, the TSF displays the TOE access banner specified in FTA_TAB.1 and responds to ICMP Echo messages with ICMP Echo Reply messages for both the remote web GUI and the local console CLI."

The certificate is not listed on the CRL. If the TSF has a cached response that has not expired, the TSF uses the cached response in lieu of querying the CRL server. The certificate chain is valid if: Each certificate in the certificate chain passes the checks described in #1 and #2. Each certificate (other than the first certificate) in the certificate chain has the Subject Type=CA flag set. Each certificate is signed by: a certificate in the certificate chain, or a trusted root CA that has been installed in the TSF. The rules for extendedKeyUsage fields are followed in all instances; Server Authentication purpose is checked for all presented Server certificates. X.509 certificates are not used for trusted updates."
