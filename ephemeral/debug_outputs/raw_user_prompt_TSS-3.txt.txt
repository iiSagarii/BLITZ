These keys are zeroized from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. The TSF also stores ephemeral keys in RAM, including TLS Session keys and DRBG State, which are zeroized when the associated TLS session terminates or when the TSF is shutdown, suffers loss of power, or restarted."
