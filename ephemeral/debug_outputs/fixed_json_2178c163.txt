**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

**For TSS-requirement#1:**
The TSS text states that the TSF uses HTTPS over TLS with versions 1.2 or 1.3. This ensures the remote administration communications are protected. This directly addresses how the trusted path is implemented and secured.

**For TSS-requirement#2:**
The SFR statement allows TLS or HTTPS. The TSS text specifies HTTPS over TLS, but doesn't list HTTPS as a protocol separately. This is a gap since the TSS should confirm all specified protocols are used.

**Ans#1 and #2 in JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "DOC": [
    {
      "SFR": "FTP_TRP.1/Admin",
      "Ans#1": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF provides a trusted path for remote administration using HTTPS over TLS. All communications are protected using TLS version 1.2 or 1.3, ensuring confidentiality and integrity between the administrator and the TOE."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FTP_TRP.1/Admin",
      "Ans#2": "This requirement is not being satisfied. The TSS should mention that HTTPS is used as the protocol for secure communication as per the SFR statement."
    }
  ],
  "Excel": [
    {
      "SFR": "FTP_TRP.1/Admin",
      "TSS-requirement": "The evaluator shall also confirm that all protocols listed in the TSS in support of TOE administration are consistent with those specified in the requirement, and are included in the requirements in the ST.",
      "Missing Information": "The TSS does not explicitly list HTTPS as a protocol used for administration communication."
    }
  ]
}
