      "Ans#1: The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using either TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3. The TSF supports TLS with mutual authentication using X509v3 certificates to secure communications with the Syslog server. Logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time.",
      "Ans#2: The TOE is a standalone TOE.",
      "Ans#3: The TOE is not a distributed TOE; hence this assurance activity is not applicable.",
      "Ans#4: The TOE is not a distributed TOE; hence this assurance activity is not applicable.",
      "Ans#5: The logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time.",
      "Ans#6: The TOE is not a distributed TOE; hence this assurance activity is not applicable.",
      "Ans#7: The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion through the restrictive administrative interfaces. The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB.",
      "Ans#8: The TSF implements local logging by maintaining log files of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format.",
      "Ans#9: These actions require the administrator to be positively identified and authenticated.",
      "Ans#10: When the active file first reaches its capacity, the TSF creates an inactive log file, moves the existing audit records into it, and continues writing new logs to a refreshed active file. From that point on, whenever the active file reaches capacity, its contents are pushed to the inactive file, overwriting its previous contents, and the active file is refreshed to store new audit logs. An audit log entry is generated each time the active file reaches capacity.",

The TSF generates ECDSA P-256, P-384 and P-521 keys for TLS client authentication, TLS server authentication, and TLS ECDHE key establishment."

      "Ans#1: The TSF uses both elliptic curve-based and RSA-based key establishment in support of TLS. When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with a server certificate containing an ECDSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3. For syslog server, the TSF acts as the client during communication with the Syslog server. The key establishment scheme selection depends on the negotiated TLS ciphersuite: For ECDHE ciphersuites, the TSF utilizes ECDHE. For other TLS ciphersuites, the TSF employs RSA-based key establishment."
