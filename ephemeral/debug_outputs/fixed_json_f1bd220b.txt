The following JSON output evaluates the provided TSS texts against their corresponding TSS-requirements for the standalone TOE.

The TSF supports TLS with mutual authentication using X509v3 certificates to secure communications with the Syslog server. Logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time."

While the file system is not directly exposed to the administrative user via the HTTPS GUI or local CLI, the administrator is provided with specific options within the GUI to clear audit logs or modify audit settings. These actions require the administrator to be positively identified and authenticated."

The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles. The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB."

When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with a server certificate containing an ECDSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3."
