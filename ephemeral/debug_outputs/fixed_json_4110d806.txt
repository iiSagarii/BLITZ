The TSF zeroizes these keys from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. The TSF stores loads the persistent keys into RAM when they are used and the TSF also stores the following ephemeral keys in RAM: TLS Session keys, DRBG State.",
      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF zeroizes the HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key on the hard disk drives by overwriting the file location with data from /dev/random three times. Each overwrite calls /dev/random ensuring that a different pseudo random pattern is used each time.",
      "Ans#3": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF zeroizes keys in RAM by writing zeros to the memory location one time and performing a read verify to ensure that the memory location was set to all zeros. If the read verify fails, the TSF repeats the zeroization process.",

This situation only impacts the keys that are stored on the disk. Since the TOE is inaccessible in this situation, administrative zeroization cannot be performed. However, all keys on the disk are protected because the TOE enables full disk encryption by default.",
