By default, the TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 1024 MB for hardware platforms and 200 MB for virtual platforms. The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion through the restrictive administrative interfaces. While the file system is not directly exposed to the administrative user via the HTTPS GUI or local CLI, the administrator is provided with specific options within the GUI to clear audit logs or modify audit settings. These actions require the administrator to be positively identified and authenticated. The TSF implements local logging by maintaining log files of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles. The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB."
