File integrity test –verifies integrity of all mounted signed packages, to assert that system files have not been tampered with. To test the integrity of the firmware, the fingerprints of the executables and other immutable files are regenerated and validated against the SHA1 fingerprints contains in the manifest file. Crypto integrity test – checks integrity of major CSPs, such as SSH hostkeys and iked credentials, such as Cas, CERTS, and various keys. Authentication error – verifies that veriexec is enabled and operates as expected using /opt/sbin/kats/cannot-exec.real. Kernel, libmd, OpenSSL, QuickSec, SSH – verifies correct output from known answer tests for appropriate algorithms."

The administrative user can logout from the TOE using CLI by typing “logout” to terminate the session. The TOE makes the current contents unreadable after the admin initiates termination. No user activity can take place until the user re-identifies and authenticates.User sessions, both remote and local, with the TOE can also be terminated due to inactivity (time threshold). Security Administrators can configure this inactivity timer on administrative sessions. Once the set inactivity period is crossed the user would be logged out form the TOE and the session would be terminated. For each user session, the TOE maintains a count of clock cycles (provided by the system clock) since the last user activity. The count is reset each time the user performs any activity within the session. When the counter reaches the number of clock cycles equating to the configured period of inactivity, the user session is locked out."
