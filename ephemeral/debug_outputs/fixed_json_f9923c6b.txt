Syslog/TLS Private Client Key – generated using the DRBG and FCS_CKM.1 or entered by the Security Administrator. The HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key are zeroized from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. The above key destruction methods apply to all configurations and circumstances, except one. The only situation where the key destruction may be prevented would be if the system suffers a crash or loss of power. This situation only impacts the keys that are stored on the disk. Since the TOE is inaccessible in this situation, administrative zeroization cannot be performed. However, all keys on the disk are protected because the TOE enables full disk encryption by default."
