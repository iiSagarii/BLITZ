**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **FIA_UIA_EXT.1 Requirement #1:**
   - The TSS text describes the remote HTTPS and local CLI authentication processes, including credentials and successful logon steps. This satisfies the requirement.
   
2. **FIA_UIA_EXT.1 Requirement #2:**
   - The TSS mentions displaying the access banner and responding to ICMP Echo messages, which are the allowed actions before authentication. This meets the requirement.

3. **FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev Requirement #1:**
   - The TSS explains certificate validation, including checking against CRL and EKU usage, indicating all required aspects are addressed.

4. **FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev Requirement #2:**
   - The TSS details when revocation checks occur and notes the leaf certificate check during authentication, which aligns with the requirement.

      "Ans#1": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF utilizes HTTPS, which operates over the TLS protocol (supporting TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3), to secure a remote administration web GUI session. When connecting over HTTPS, the TSF presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt; The Security Administrator using password authentication is considered authenticated if the username and the SHA-256 hash of the password matches the stored username and SHA-256 password hash. A successful authentication takes the user to the System Status page. The TSF utilizes a local serial CLI which presents Security Administrators with a username and password prompt. The Security Administrator is considered authenticated if the username and password provided match the credentials configured in the TSF. A successful login takes the user to the CLI menu."

      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: Prior to successful identification and authentication, the TSF displays the TOE access banner specified in FTA_TAB.1 and responds to ICMP Echo messages with ICMP Echo Reply messages for both the remote web GUI and the local console CLI."

      "Ans#1": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The rules for extendedKeyUsage fields are followed in all instances; Server Authentication purpose is checked for all presented Server certificates. The TOE’s trust anchor store is expected to include both CA and Intermediate CA certificates. When an Intermediate CA certificate is uploaded to the TOE’s trust store, the TOE performs revocation checking on that certificate as part of the validation process. During authentication, the TOE performs revocation checking only on the leaf certificate, regardless of whether a full certificate chain or only the leaf certificate is presented. No different handling is applied based on the structure of the certificate chain."

      "SFR": "FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev",
      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF verifies the validity of a certificate in the following situations: Intermediate CA certificate: When an Intermediate CA certificate is uploaded to the TOE’s trust store, the TSF verifies its authenticity and validity, including revocation status, before accepting it into the trust anchor store. Syslog Server Certificate Verification: When the TSF connects to a Syslog server, it verifies the server’s certificate to confirm its authenticity and validity, including revocation status, before establishing a trusted connection. Client Certificate Authentication: When the TSF uses its client certificate to authenticate with the Syslog server, it verifies that its own certificate is valid and correctly issued. If the Client Authentication EKU is absent, the TSF rejects the certificate during upload and does not allow it to be used for mutual authentication with the Syslog server."
