By default, the TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 1024 MB for hardware platforms and 200 MB for virtual platforms. The TSF divides local audit storage between two audit files: active and inactive. During initial setup, only the active log file exists. When this file first reaches its capacity, the TSF creates an inactive log file, moves the existing audit records into it, and continues writing new logs to a refreshed active file. From that point on, whenever the active file reaches capacity, its contents are pushed to the inactive file, overwriting its previous contents, and the active file is refreshed to store new audit logs. An audit log entry is generated each time the active file reaches capacity."
