Syslog/TLS Private Client Key – generated using the DRBG and FCS_CKM.1 or entered by the Security Administrator. The HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key are zeroized from the disk when the Security Administrator deletes the key, replaces the key, or zeroizes the entire TOE. The TSF zeroizes the HTTPS/TLS Private Host Key and the Syslog/TLS Private Client key on the hard disk drives by overwriting the file location with data from /dev/random three times. HTTPS/TLS keys are zeroized from RAM when the HTTP or Syslog process terminates. The TLS Session keys are zeroized from RAM when the associated TLS session is terminated. The DRBG state and all ephemeral keys are zeroized when the TSF is shutdown, suffers loss of power, or restarted."
