During initial setup, only the active log file exists. When this file first reaches its capacity, the TSF creates an inactive log file, moves the existing audit records into it, and continues writing new logs to a refreshed active file. From that point on, whenever the active file reaches capacity, its contents are pushed to the inactive file, overwriting its previous contents, and the active file is refreshed to store new audit logs. An audit log entry is generated each time the active file reaches capacity."

When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with a server certificate containing an ECDSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3. For syslog server, The TSF acts as the client during communication with the Syslog server. The key establishment scheme selection depends on the negotiated TLS ciphersuite: For ECDHE ciphersuites, the TSF utilizes ECDHE. For other TLS ciphersuites, the TSF employs RSA-based key establishment. See FCS_TLS* description below for more details."
