Here is the JSON-formatted output based on the evaluation:

  "DOC": [
    {
      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#1": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using either TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3. The TSF supports TLS with mutual authentication using X509v3 certificates to secure communications with the Syslog server. Logs are sent to the Syslog servers in real-time."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TOE is a standalone TOE. The TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file, but the administrator can configure the file size for each log file up to a maximum of 1024 MB for hardware platforms and 200 MB for virtual platforms. The TOE maintains three separate log files locally, namely Events, User Access, and Admin Access."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#3": "The TOE is not a distributed TOE; hence this assurance activity is not applicable."

      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#5": "This requirement is not being satisfied. The information to be included in the TSS as per FAU_STG_EXT.1 is: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it details whether the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity can be done in real-time, periodically, or both. In the case where the TOE is capable of performing transmission periodically, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS provides details about what event stimulates the transmission to be made as well as the possible acceptable frequency for the transfer of audit data."
    },

      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#7": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The minimum configurable storage size that can be allocated for each of the three log files is 1 MB. The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion through the restrictive administrative interfaces."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#8": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TSF implements local logging by maintaining log files of audit records. The logs are stored in a persistent format, ensuring that audit records are preserved across reboots or power cycles."

      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#9": "This requirement is not being satisfied. The information to be included in the TSS as per FAU_STG_EXT.1 is: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it describes the conditions that must be met for authorized deletion of audit records."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FAU_STG_EXT.1",
      "Ans#10": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: When the active file reaches capacity, its contents are pushed to the inactive file, overwriting its previous contents, and the active file is refreshed to store new audit logs. An audit log entry is generated each time the active file reaches capacity."
    },
    {

The TSF generates ECDSA P-256, P-384 and P-521 keys for TLS client authentication, TLS server authentication, and TLS ECDHE key establishment."
    },
    {
      "SFR": "FCS_CKM.2",
      "Ans#1": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with an ECDSA key, the TSF utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3. For syslog server communication, the TSF uses ECDHE for ECDHE ciphersuites and RSA-based for others."
