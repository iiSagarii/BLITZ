File integrity test –verifies integrity of all mounted signed packages, to assert that system files have not been tampered with. To test the integrity of the firmware, the fingerprints of the executables and other immutable files are regenerated and validated against the SHA1 fingerprints contains in the manifest file. Crypto integrity test – checks integrity of major CSPs, such as SSH hostkeys and iked credentials, such as Cas, CERTS, and various keys. Authentication error – verifies that veriexec is enabled and operates as expected using /opt/sbin/kats/cannot-exec.real. Kernel, libmd, OpenSSL, QuickSec, SSH – verifies correct output from known answer tests for appropriate algorithms."
