Security Administrators can configure this inactivity timer on administrative sessions. Once the set inactivity period is crossed the user would be logged out form the TOE and the session would be terminated. For each user session, the TOE maintains a count of clock cycles (provided by the system clock) since the last user activity. The count is reset each time the user performs any activity within the session. When the counter reaches the number of clock cycles equating to the configured period of inactivity, the user session is locked out."

For both local and remote methods of access, the TOE provides an access banner prior to login, with the authentication prompt. These banners can be configured by the security administrator for both local and remote login methods.
