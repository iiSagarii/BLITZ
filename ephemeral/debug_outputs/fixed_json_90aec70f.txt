**Ans#1 for FMT_SMR.2:**  
Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that:  
The TOE supports a Security Administrator role, which is responsible for provisioning user accounts. Only users associated with the "security-admin" login class can manage the TOE. The TOE does not detail if there are restrictions or if different types of administrators with varying privileges are supported.

**Missing Information:**  
The TSS does not specify whether local and remote administrators have different privileges or if multiple types of administrators with varying privileges are supported. This information needs to be added to the TSS text for FMT_SMR.2.
