**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash Evaluation:**
   - **TSS-requirement:** Ensures HMAC details (key length, hash function, block size, output MAC length) are specified.
   - **TSS Complies:** The TSS text provides all required details for each HMAC algorithm used.
   - **Ans#1:** The exact information from TSS is included.

2. **FCS_COP.1/SigGen Evaluation:**
   - **TSS-requirement:** Checks supported cryptographic algorithms and key sizes.
   - **TSS Complies:** TSS lists RSA and ECDSA with specified key sizes and compliance with FIPS.
   - **Ans#1:** Relevant information from TSS is included.

3. **FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1 Evaluation:**
   - **TSS-requirement:** Verifies compliance with RFC 2818.
   - **TSS Partial Comply:** TSS mentions RFC 2818 but lacks specific compliance details beyond a general statement.
   - **Gap Identified:** Missing specific RFC 2818 references, only general compliance noted.
