The default inactivity timeout is 10 minutes, and the configurable range is from 5 to 9999999 minutes. Although the inactivity timeout is configurable within a wide range, it is strongly recommended that the Security Administrator configure the timeout value between 5 to 15 minutes."

The banner can provide warnings against unauthorized access to the TOE as well as any other information that the Security Administrator wishes to communicate. The TSF presents the access banner prior to authentication when a user connects via either the remote web GUI or the local console CLI. The banner is applied uniformly across both GUI and CLI administrative access methods and can be configured during initial setup."

The communication includes authentication, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs transmitted to the syslog server. The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3, supporting mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. Logs are sent to the syslog server in real-time and stored locally if the connection is unavailable. The TSF ensures assured identification of the syslog server by verifying its certificate using domain name or IP address matching, as per RFC 2818. This verification is supported for both the CN and SAN fields in the server certificate."
