      "Ans#1": "The TSF implements the Security Administrator role to authorized administrators of the TOE. The TSF allows the Security Administrators to administer the TSF via CLI through a serial cable connected to the TOE and a web GUI over a remote HTTPS channel. The TSF permissions restrict access to these management functions to users that have been identified, authenticated, and authorized with the Security Administrator role. The web GUI allow the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions using the instructions provided in the administrative guide: Ability to administer the TOE remotely; Ability to configure the access banner; Ability to configure the remote session inactivity time before session termination; Ability to update the TOE, and to verify the updates using digital signature capability prior to installing those updates; Ability to configure local audit behaviour (e.g. changes to storage locations for audit; changes to behaviour when local audit storage space is full; changes to local audit storage size); Ability to modify the behaviour of the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity; Ability to manage the cryptographic keys; Ability to configure the cryptographic functionality; Ability to set the time which is used for time-stamps; Ability to manage the TOE’s trust store and designate X509.v3 certificates as trust anchors; Ability to generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and process CA certificate response; Ability to administer the TOE locally; Ability to configure the local session inactivity time before session termination or locking; Ability to configure the authentication failure parameters for FIA_AFL.1. The local console allows the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions using the instructions provided in the administrative guide: Ability to update the TOE, and to verify the updates using digital signature capability prior to installing those updates."
