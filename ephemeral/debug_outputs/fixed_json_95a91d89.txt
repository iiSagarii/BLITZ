The number of attempts can be configured within a range of 3 to 10. The lockout duration can be configured between 3 and 999 minutes. If a Security Administrator enters an incorrect password the configured number of times, the administrator is locked out and cannot log in through any remote interface on the TOE. Once the lockout duration has expired, the administrator is permitted to authenticate to the TOE again.",
