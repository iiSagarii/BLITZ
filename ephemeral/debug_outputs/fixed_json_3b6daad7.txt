The TSF allocates 200 MB to each log file by default, but the administrator can configure the file size up to a maximum of 1024 MB for hardware platforms and 200 MB for virtual platforms. The TSF divides local audit storage between two audit files: active and inactive. When the active file reaches its capacity, the TSF creates an inactive log file, moves the existing audit records into it, and continues writing new logs to a refreshed active file. The TSF protects audit data from unauthorized modification and deletion through the restrictive administrative interfaces. The administrator is provided with specific options within the GUI to clear audit logs or modify audit settings, which require positive identification and authentication."
