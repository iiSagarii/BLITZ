If the certificate does not contain any Subject Alternative Name fields, the TSF matches the domain name against the Common Name in the certificate. When the server is specified using an IP address, the TSF verifies that the IP address exactly matches a Subject Alternative Name IP Address field in the certificate using the rules specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 2818. If the certificate does not contain any Subject Alternative Name fields, the TSF matches the IP address against the Common Name in the certificate. The TSF does support wildcards but does not support certificate pinning and determines if the certificate is valid for the specified server based on the DNS name or IP address of the server. Wildcards are supported only at the left-most label of the identifier."
