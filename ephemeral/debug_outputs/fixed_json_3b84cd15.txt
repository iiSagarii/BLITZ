      "Ans#1: The TOE time function is reliant on the system clock provided by the underlying hardware. TOE depends on time and date information provided by a local real-time clock that is manually managed by the Security Administrator on a timely basis, in accordance with the organization’s policy. The TSF uses the system time to timestamp audit log records, to determine user session timeouts, and to determine certificate validity. These uses of time do not require an accuracy finer than one second, and the frequency of updating the time keeps the clock drifting under one second.",

      "Ans#1: The TSF performs the following hardware self-tests at power-on: Cryptographic library tests: HMAC-SHA-256 integrity check of the library, HMAC-SHA-1 KAT, HMAC-SHA-256 KAT, HMAC-SHA-384 KAT, AES 128 ECB Encrypt and Decrypt KAT, AES 256 GCM Encrypt and Decrypt KAT, RSA 2048 SHA-256 Sign and Verify KAT, ECDSA P-224 SHA-512 Sign and Verify PCT, DRBG AES-CTR-256 KAT. Firmware checks: SHA-512 digital signature verification of the manifest file, SHA-256 integrity check of each executable file in the TSF using the pre-calculated hashes from the manifest file.",
      "Ans#2: The Cryptographic library tests verify that each cryptographic algorithm specified in FCS_COP.1 requirements is passing a KAT. The KAT demonstrates that the algorithm is functioning properly by invoking the algorithm with hard coded keys and messages and comparing the result to a pre-computed, known to be correct value. The ECDSA PCT shows that the ECDSA algorithm is functioning properly by signing a known value with a known key and verifying that verifying the computed signature indicates that the signature is valid.",
      "Ans#3: If the cryptographic library tests fail, the TSF will not start up. If an integrity check fails, the TSF will let the admin choose between Reboot, Rollback, or Continue Booting.",
