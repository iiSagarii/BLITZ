When the TOE is configured with a server certificate containing an RSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and employs RSA-based key establishment (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5). When configured with a server certificate containing an ECDSA key, the TSF acts as the TLS server and utilizes the elliptic curve-based establishment scheme aligned with NIST SP 800-56A Rev. 3."
