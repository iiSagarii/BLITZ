No management of TSF data can be performed through any interface prior to login. Only administrators can login to the administrative interface, ensuring that access to TSF data is disallowed for non-administrative users.",
      "Ans#2": "Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: The TOE provides a trust store to handle the X.509v3 certificates. The permissions on the trust store restrict access so that only Security Administrator users can import or delete certificates from the trust store. Security Administrator users can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. Non Security Administrator users can only view the certificates but cannot import or delete them."

These actions respectively generate or delete the associated cryptographic key pair. For Device certificates, the administrator navigates to System > Configuration > Certificates > Device Certificates, where similar options exist to generate or delete a CSR, with the corresponding generation or deletion of the associated cryptographic keys."
