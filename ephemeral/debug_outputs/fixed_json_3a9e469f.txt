The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any of the functions to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.",

The permissions on the trust store restrict access so that only Security Administrators can import or delete certificates from the trust store. Security Administrators can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. No other access to the trust store is allowed."
