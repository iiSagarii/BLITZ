File integrity test –verifies integrity of all mounted signed packages, to assert that system files have not been tampered with. Crypto integrity test – checks integrity of major CSPs, such as SSH hostkeys and iked credentials. Authentication error – verifies that veriexec is enabled and operates as expected using /opt/sbin/kats/cannot-exec.real. Kernel, libmd, OpenSSL, QuickSec, SSH – verifies correct output from known answer tests for appropriate algorithms. When any self-test fails, the device halts in an error state. No command line input or traffic to any interface is processed. The device must be power cycled to attempt to return to operation."
