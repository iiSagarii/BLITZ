SFR statement for FTA_SSL_EXT.1:
FTA_SSL_EXT.1.1
The TSF Shall, for local interactive sessions, [
terminate the session]
after a Security Administrator-specified time period of inactivity

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1:
The TOE acts as a server for remote sessions accessed through the management interface. The local and Remote administrative sessions can be terminated by users using the instructions provided below:
To log out of the remote web GUI, go to the user type icon on the top right of the screen and click logout.
To exit a local console session, choose option 11 Exit Serial Console Session on the local serial console.
The Security Administrator can set the TOE so that local and remote sessions are terminated after a Security Administrator-configured period of inactivity. The default inactivity timeout is 10 minutes, and the configurable range is from 5 to 9999999 minutes. Although the inactivity timeout is configurable within a wide range, it is strongly recommended that the Security Administrator configure the timeout value between 5 to 15 minutes.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_SSL_EXT.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it details whether local administrative session locking or termination is supported and the related inactivity time period settings.
Ans#1 for FTA_SSL_EXT.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_SSL_EXT.1>

SFR statement for FTA_TAB.1:
FTA_TAB.1.1
Before establishing a an administrative user session the TSF shall display a Security Administrator-specified advisory notice and consent warning message regarding unauthorised use of the TOE.
Trusted Path/Channels (FTP)

--------------------

TSS text for FTA_TAB.1:
The TSF enables Security Administrators to configure an access banner provided with the authentication prompt. The banner can provide warnings against unauthorized access to the TOE as well as any other information that the Security Administrator wishes to communicate. The TSF presents the access banner prior to authentication when a user connects via either the remote web GUI or the local console CLI. The banner is applied uniformly across both GUI and CLI administrative access methods and can be configured during initial setup.
The remote web GUI is accessed over a secure HTTPS connection using TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3, while the local console CLI is accessed through a direct serial console connection. This behavior is described in the FIA_UIA_EXT.1, FIA_UAU_EXT.2 description.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTA_TAB.1: The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that it details each administrative method of access (local and/or remote) available to the Security Administrator (e.g., serial port, SSH, HTTPS).
Ans#1 for FTA_TAB.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTA_TAB.1>
TSS-requirement#2 for FTA_TAB.1: The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure that all administrative methods of access available to the Security Administrator are listed and that the TSS states that the TOE is displaying an advisory notice and a consent warning message for each administrative method of access. The advisory notice and the consent warning message might be different for different administrative methods of access and might be configured during initial configuration (e.g. via configuration file).

SFR statement for FTP_ITC.1:
FTP_ITC.1.1
The TSF shall be capable of using [TLS] to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and another trusted IT product authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server, [no other capabilities] that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data.
FTP_ITC.1.2
The TSF shall permit [the TSF] to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
FTP_ITC.1.3
The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for [audit server communications].

--------------------

TSS text for FTP_ITC.1:
The TSF acts as a client and communicates with the external syslog server using Syslog over TLS. The communication includes authentication, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs transmitted to the syslog server. The TSF implements Syslog over TLS using TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3, supporting mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. Logs are sent to the syslog server in real-time and stored locally if the connection is unavailable. The TSF ensures assured identification of the syslog server by verifying its certificate using domain name or IP address matching, as per RFC 2818. This verification is supported for both the CN and SAN fields in the server certificate. The implementation of Syslog over TLS and the associated secure communications are described in more detail in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 and FCS_TLSC_EXT.2.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that, for all communications with authorized IT entities identified in the requirement, each secure communication mechanism is identified in terms of the allowed protocols for that IT entity, whether the TOE acts as a server or a client, and the method of assured identification of the non-TSF endpoint.

TSS-requirement#2 for FTP_ITC.1: The evaluator shall also confirm that all secure communication mechanisms are described in sufficient detail to allow the evaluator to match them to the cryptographic protocol Security Functional Requirements listed in the ST.
Ans#2 for FTP_ITC.1: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1 here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FTP_ITC.1>
