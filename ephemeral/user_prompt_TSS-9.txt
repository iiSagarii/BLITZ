SFR statement for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate:
FMT_MOF.1.1/ManualUpdate
The TSF shall restrict the ability to enable the function to perform manual updates to Security Administrators.

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate:
The TSF implements the Security Administrator role to authorized administrators of the TOE. The TSF allows the Security Administrators to administer the TSF via CLI through a serial cable connected to the TOE and a web GUI over a remote HTTPS channel. The TSF permissions restrict access to these management functions to users that have been identified, authenticated, and authorized with the Security Administrator role.
The web GUI allow the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions using the instructions provided in the administrative guide:
Ability to administer the TOE remotely
Ability to configure the access banner
Ability to configure the remote session inactivity time before session termination
Ability to update the TOE, and to verify the updates using digital signature capability prior to installing those updates
Ability to configure local audit behaviour (e.g. changes to storage locations for audit; changes to behaviour when local audit storage space is full; changes to local audit storage size)
Ability to modify the behaviour of the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity
Ability to manage the cryptographic keys
Ability to configure the cryptographic functionality
Ability to set the time which is used for time-stamps
Ability to manage the TOE’s trust store and designate X509.v3 certificates as trust anchors
Ability to generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and process CA certificate response
Ability to administer the TOE locally
Ability to configure the local session inactivity time before session termination or locking
Ability to configure the authentication failure parameters for FIA_AFL.1
The local console allows the Security Administrator to perform the following TSF management functions using the instructions provided in the administrative guide:
Ability to update the TOE, and to verify the updates using digital signature capability prior to installing those updates
The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any of these functions to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.
The TOE provides a trust store to store certificates. The permissions on the trust store restrict access so that only Security Administrator users can import or delete certificates from the trust store. Security Administrator users can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. Non Security Administrator users can only view the certificates but cannot import or delete them.
The TSF restricts the ability to modify the behavior of audit-related functions to Security Administrators. For the transmission of audit data to an external IT entity, Security Administrators can configure the destination address, TLS protocol, and source port for communication with an external syslog server. Audit forwarding is automatically enabled when this configuration is present and automatically disabled when the configuration is removed; there is no separate control to explicitly enable or disable the feature. With respect to the handling of audit data, Security Administrators have control over local audit management functions, including the ability to clear existing logs and configure the maximum log size. When the local audit storage space becomes full, the TOE automatically overwrites the oldest audit records. This log overwrite behavior is fixed and cannot be configured by the Security Administrator.

Ans#1 for FMT_MOF.1/ManualUpdate: For distributed TOEs see Section 5.1.4.1. [CPP_ND_V3.0E-SD]. There are no specific requirements for non-distributed TOEs.

SFR statement for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData:
FMT_MTD.1.1/CoreData
The TSF shall restrict the ability to manage the TSF data to Security Administrators.

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData:
The only functions accessible prior to authentication are the display of the configurable warning and consent banner and the automated response to ICMP echo messages with ICMP echo reply messages. No management of TSF data can be performed through any interface prior to login. Only administrators can login to the administrative interface, ensuring that access to TSF data is disallowed for non-administrative users.
The administrative interfaces provided by the TSF do not allow any other functions other than the ones mentioned above to be accessed by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.
The TOE provides a trust store to handle the X.509v3 certificates. The permissions on the trust store restrict access so that only Security Administrator users can import or delete certificates from the trust store. Security Administrator users can also view the certificates stored in the trust store. Non Security Administrator users can only view the certificates but cannot import or delete them.

--------------------

TSS-requirement#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: For each administrative function identified in the guidance documentation that is accessible through an interface prior to administrator log-in, the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS details how the ability to manipulate the TSF data through these interfaces is disallowed for non-administrative users.
Ans#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData >
TSS-requirement#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: If the TOE supports handling of X.509v3 certificates and implements a trust store, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it contains sufficient information to describe how the ability to manage the TOE’s trust store is restricted.
Ans#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CoreData >

SFR statement for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys:
FMT_MTD.1.1/CryptoKeys
The TSF shall restrict the ability to manage the cryptographic keys to Security Administrators.

--------------------

TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys:
The TOE restricts the ability to manage configured X.509 certificates (public and private key pairs) to security administrators via GUI.
The Security Administrator can generate and delete the cryptographic keys associated with CSRs as follows:
For Client Authentication certificates, the administrator navigates to System > Configuration > Certificates > Client Auth Certificates, where options are available to generate a CSR and delete an existing CSR. These actions respectively generate or delete the associated cryptographic key pair.
For Device certificates, the administrator navigates to System > Configuration > Certificates > Device Certificates, where similar options exist to generate or delete a CSR, with the corresponding generation or deletion of the associated cryptographic keys.

--------------------

Ans#1 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys:  For distributed TOEs see Section 2.4.1.1.
TSS-requirement#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys: For non-distributed TOEs, the evaluator shall ensure the TSS lists the keys the Security Administrator is able to manage to include the options available (e.g. generating keys, importing keys, modifying keys or deleting keys) and how that how those operations are performed.
Ans#2 for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys: Upon investigation, the evaluator found that the TSS states that: <paste the exact information from the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys here OR mention what is missing and is to be added into the TSS text for FMT_MTD.1/CryptoKeys>
